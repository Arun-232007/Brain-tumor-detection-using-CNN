##Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (CNN)

#Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained on brain MRI scans and can classify images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor.

The system automatically learns features from MRI images and assists in identifying tumor types with high accuracy.

##Objectives

Detect brain tumors from MRI images.
Classify tumors into different categories.
Automate medical image analysis using Deep Learning.
Support faster and more accurate diagnosis.

Testing Images: 1600
Validation Accuracy: 86.94%
Trained Model: brain_tumor_model.h5
## Trained Model

The trained model file (`brain_tumor_model.h5`) is not included due to GitHub file size limitations. The model can be recreated by running `brain_tumor.py`. Because its an computer readable binary format.
